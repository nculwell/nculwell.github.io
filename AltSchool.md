# Dinosaur Books

## School-type books (various subjects).

I haven't read most of these yet; this is really just a collection of ideas for me to follow up later.

* Thom Holmes, *The Prehistoric Earth* series ([Worldcat search for the whole series](https://www.worldcat.org/search?q=se%3A%22Prehistoric+earth.%22+au%3Aholmes&qt=results_page#%2528x0%253Abook%2Bx4%253Aprintbook%2529format)) - History of life on earth, written at a middle school / early high school level. Pretty good overview but lacks pictures, which is a fairly serious drawback (both children's and adults' books on the subject typically have more of them).
  * *Last of the dinosaurs: the Cretaceous period* (2009, ISBN 9780816059621, [Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/last-of-the-dinosaurs-the-cretaceous-period/oclc/607552529))
* The World in Ancient Times (OUP)
  * The Ancient Near Eastern World / Amanda H. Podany, Marni McGee
    (2005, ISBN 9780195161595, [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/Ancient-Near-Eastern-World-Times/dp/0195161599))
  * The World in Ancient Times: Primary Sources & Reference Volume / Ronald Mellor, Amanda H. Podany
    (2005, ISBN 9780195222203, [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/World-Ancient-Times-Primary-Reference/dp/0195222202))
  * etc.
* Matloff, American Military History: 1775-1902; 1902-1996
* Everything You Need to Ace World History in One Big Fat Notebook (surprisingly good for what it is, there's also a US history one)
