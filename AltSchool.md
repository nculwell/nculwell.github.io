title: School-type books

I haven't read most of these yet; this is really just a collection of ideas for me to follow up later.

* Thom Holmes, *The Prehistoric Earth* series ([Worldcat search for the whole
  series](https://www.worldcat.org/search?q=se%3A%22Prehistoric+earth.%22+au%3Aholmes&qt=results_page#%2528x0%253Abook%2Bx4%253Aprintbook%2529format)) -
  History of life on earth, written at a middle school / early high school
  level. Pretty good overview but it's in serious need of more pictures, which
  is a fairly serious drawback (both children's and adults' books on the
  subject typically have more of them).

  * etc.

* Matloff, American Military History: 1775-1902; 1902-1996
* Everything You Need to Ace World History in One Big Fat Notebook (surprisingly good for what it is, there's also a US history one)

* <https://smile.amazon.com/People-Different-Starting-Point-Science/dp/0746010141>
* Usborne Visitor's Guide to the Ancient World - Somewhat more in-depth than Usborne World History.
  Actually makes a nod toward prudishness, which some people will prefer to the partial nudity of Ancient World and Time Traveler.
  Get the hardcover, the paperback is small and has a flimsy binding.
