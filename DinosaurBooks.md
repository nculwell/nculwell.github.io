## Baby books, dinosaur-themed stories

* *Stomp, Dinosaur, Stomp* / Margaret Mayo ([Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/stomp-dinosaur-stomp/oclc/988922247&referer=brief_results), [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/140830385X))
* *Dinosaur Days* / Joyce Milton (1985 edition: [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00430CY9I), [Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/dinosaurs/oclc/758978206); 2014 edition: [Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/dinosaur-days/oclc/890680143), [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0385379234)) - The 1985 edition of this book had a lot of staying power early on in our dinosaur phase, and we read it so much that my son had it mostly memorized. Although it's not poetry, the simple words have a nice cadence. The 1985 edition is somewhat outdated, but not painfully so, and I prefer its art style to the newer one.
* *Dinosaurs: 4 favorite stories* (Scholastic Reader Collection) ([Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/dinosaurs/oclc/954612918&referer=brief_results), [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/Dinosaurs-Grace-Maccarone/dp/0439932513))
* How Do Dinosaurs...? / Yolen, Jane; Teague, Mark
  * How Do Dinosaurs Say Goodnight? ([Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/how-do-dinosaurs-say-good-night/oclc/712597120&referer=brief_results), [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0590316818))
  * How Do Dinosaurs Go To School? ([Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/how-do-dinosaurs-go-to-school/oclc/809199976), [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/How-Do-Dinosaurs-Go-School/dp/0439020816))
  * etc.
* All aboard the dinotrain / Lund, Deb
* Fossil / Thomson, Bill
* Captain Raptor and the moon mystery / O'Malley, Kevin
* Meet the Dinotrux / Gall, Chris
* Ally-Saurus & the first day of school / Torrey, Rich
* Dinosaur round-up (DC Super Friends)
* Time for school, little dinosaur / Herman, Gail ; Fleming, Michael
* A trip to dinosaur time / Foreman, Michael ([Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/trip-to-dinosaur-time/oclc/50936568))
* Danny and the Dinosaur / Hoff ([Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/danny-and-the-dinosaur/oclc/965731837&referer=brief_results), [Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/danny-and-the-dinosaur-treasury/oclc/123498479&referer=brief_results), [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0064440028))

## More detailed for kids

* Prehistoric World (Usborne) ([Worldcat/2000](https://www.worldcat.org/title/usborne-world-history-prehistoric-world/oclc/896783088&referer=brief_results), [Worldcat/2012](https://www.worldcat.org/title/prehistoric-world/oclc/751835291&referer=brief_results), [Amazon/2000](https://smile.amazon.com/Prehistoric-World-History-Usborne/dp/0746027583), [Amazon/2012](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/140953426X))

  I loved the pictures in this book and it got read a lot. It goes from the dawn of life through early humans, with plenty of dinosaurs. The 2012 edition appears to be basically a reprint of the 2000 edition with a new cover.

* Modern Publishing (Rupert Oliver; Ron Wilson; Angela Royston; etc.)

  Omnibus editions of all Modern Publishing books. They are out-of-date (1980s) and the illustrations are sometimes goofy but my kid loves them and he really appreciates the large selection of animals that they cover. A few of the stories are truly memorable, including one (Allosaurus) that is the only children's story book I can think of that features the protagonist being killed and devoured in the final pages.

  * Dinosaurs and Prehistoric Creatures (ISBN 1561447730, [Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/dinosaurs-and-prehistoric-creatures/oclc/18044792), [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/1561447730))
  * Colossal Book of Dinosaurs (ISBN 1561447757, [Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/colossal-book-of-dinosaurs-featuring-the-dinosaur-dictionary/oclc/38498607), [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/1561447757))
  * Mammoth Book of Dinosaurs (ISBN 1561447765, [WC](https://www.worldcat.org/title/mammoth-book-of-dinosaurs/oclc/868182676), [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/1561447765)
  * Dinosaurs Of The Land, Sea And Air (ISBN 1561447749, [WC](https://www.worldcat.org/title/dinosaurs-of-the-land-sea-and-air/oclc/609080515), [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/1561447749))

* Don Lessem
  * The Ultimate Dinopedia (1e/2010 ISBN 1426301642, [Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/ultimate-dinopedia-the-most-complete-dinosaur-reference-ever/oclc/769762610), [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/1426301642); 2e/2017 ISBN 1426329059, [Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/national-geographic-kids-ultimate-dinopedia/oclc/969372009), [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/1426329059)) - Full-page artwork of each dinosaur in action, along with pronunciation guides and entertaining text, make this a pretty ideal first "encyclopedia" type dinosaur book for both parent and child. I notice that there's a new edition (2nd, 2017) but I haven't seen it yet.
  * Sea giants of dinosaur time; Giant meat-eating dinosaurs; etc.
  * Dinosaurs to dodos : an encyclopedia of extinct animals / Lessem and Sovak
* Dougal Dixon
  * Reptiles rule: Triassic life; etc. (Awesome Ancient Animals)
  * Stegosaurus : and other plains dinosaurs; etc. (Dinosaur Find)
  * Complete Illustrated Encyclopedia ([Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/complete-illustrated-encyclopedia-of-dinosaurs-prehistoric-creatures-the-ultimate-illustrated-reference-guide-to-1000-dinosaurs-and-prehistoric-creatures-with-2000-specially-commissioned-artworks-maps-and-photographs/oclc/944351418), [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/1846812097)) - The format of the new (2014) paperback edition of this one is really too small for what it is (6.8 x 8.5 inches), but it is cheap. It covers a very large number of dinosaur species, which makes it a wide-ranging reference, but it's not the most attractive for children and it doesn't have a lot to say about each species.

* Dinosaurs Through Time / Rupert Matthews, McRae Books (ISBN 8860980429, [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/8860980429)) - General overview of Mesozoic animal life, organized chronologically. It coverage doesn't really stand out, but nice full-page artwork makes it worthwhile.
* Dinosaurs Through Time / Harris, Nicholas ; Scott, Peter David ; Dennis, Peter ([A](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/143582802X)) - Follows the life of a Mamenchisaurus from birth to death to fossilization.
* Zoehfeld and Washburn (Let's Read and Find Out Science) - Excellent book that each focus on a fairly narrow topic.
  * Where did dinosaurs come from? ([w](https://www.worldcat.org/title/where-did-dinosaurs-come-from/oclc/813919873), [a](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0064452166)) - History of evolution up until the dinosaurs.
  * Dinosaurs big and small ([w](https://www.worldcat.org/title/dinosaurs-big-and-small/oclc/966744777), [a](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0064451828)) - Overview of various dinosaurs.
  * etc.
* Life-size dinosaurs / Bergen, David ([w](https://www.worldcat.org/title/life-size-dinosaurs/oclc/56389198), [a](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/140271775X))

* Hannah Bonner
  * A Cartoon Prehistory of Life - I appreciated this series a lot because it emphasizes the major periods of evolution rather than individual species. It's a really fresh presentation that I would've liked to spend more time with. However, I found it difficult to explain to my son because it has many humorous cartoons. Jokes are always difficult to explain because it's hard to convey what should and shouldn't be taken literally; because of this, I feel like this is better suited to somewhat older children. Still worth a look for the little ones, but don't expect them to fully appreciate it.
    * 2012 omnibus: *When Fish Got Feet, When Bugs Were Big, and When Dinos Dawned* (ISBN 1426321058, [Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/when-fish-got-feet-when-bugs-were-big-when-dinos-dawned-a-cartoon-prehistory-of-life-on-earth/oclc/973542194), [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/When-Fish-Feet-Dinos-Dawned/dp/1426321058))
