## Baby books, dinosaur-themed stories

* Stomp, Dinosaur, Stomp / Margaret Mayo ([Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/stomp-dinosaur-stomp/oclc/988922247), [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/140830385X))
* Dinosaur Days / Joyce Milton (1985 edition: [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00430CY9I), [Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/dinosaurs/oclc/758978206); 2014 edition: [Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/dinosaur-days/oclc/890680143), [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0385379234)) - The 1985 edition of this book had a lot of staying power early on in our dinosaur phase, and we read it so much that my son had it mostly memorized. Although it's not in verse, the simple words have a nice cadence. The 1985 edition is somewhat outdated, but not painfully so, and I prefer its art style to the newer one.
* Dinosaurs: 4 favorite stories (Scholastic Reader Collection)
  ([Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/dinosaurs/oclc/954612918),
  [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/Dinosaurs-Grace-Maccarone/dp/0439932513)) -
  As the title says, a collection of four (older) books. Two have very basic
  artwork and the other two have pretty detailed art. We read these a lot of
  times, and it still comes out occasionally; on the merits the stories aren't
  that great objectively but they have a certain charm to them.
* How Do Dinosaurs...? / Yolen, Jane; Teague, Mark - Just about all of these books follow the same template: most of the book lists ways in which "dinosaurs" might misbehave (posed as question), followed by some examples of how they behave correctly. The main draw is the amusing illustrations of huge dinosaurs doing things that children do. These are probably the most popular recent dinosaur books, and they are available as board books.
  * How Do Dinosaurs Say Goodnight? ([Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/how-do-dinosaurs-say-good-night/oclc/712597120), [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0590316818))
  * How Do Dinosaurs Go To School? ([Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/how-do-dinosaurs-go-to-school/oclc/809199976), [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/How-Do-Dinosaurs-Go-School/dp/0439020816))
  * etc.
* All aboard the dinotrain / Lund, Deb - This is a silly story about dinosaurs riding on a train. Trains plus dinosaurs is a winning combo for a lot of kids.
* Chalk / Thomson, Bill - One of Bill Thomson's stories that's told entirely in pictures. A group of kids finds a piece of chalk that makes what they draw come to life. His other books that we read (Fossil and The Typewriter) were good also. His art style is very realistic.
* Captain Raptor and the Moon Mystery / O'Malley, Kevin - A comic book space opera for children, featuring a swashbuckling therapod protagonist. There's another, Captain Raptor and the Space Pirates, but Moon Mystery is a bit more interesting in my opinion and the two are extremely similar in structure. The art style is very catchy. I find ordinary comic books (DC/Marvel) impossible to read to a young child because of how the frames and text work together, but I didn't have that problem with these.
* Meet the Dinotrux / Gall, Chris - Dinosaurs that are trucks. They behave very badly. There are three or four of these books, we read them all.
* Ally-Saurus & the first day of school / Torrey, Rich - About a girl who pretends to be a dinosaur.
* Dinosaur round-up (DC Super Friends) - An episode of Super Friends involving dinosaurs. These children's DC comics are manageable, they are formatted like regular children's book instead of like comic books.
* Time for school, little dinosaur / Herman, Gail ; Fleming, Michael
* A trip to dinosaur time / Foreman, Michael ([Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/trip-to-dinosaur-time/oclc/50936568)) - Child travels back through time and sees dinosaurs.
* Danny and the Dinosaur / Hoff ([Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/danny-and-the-dinosaur/oclc/965731837), [Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/danny-and-the-dinosaur-treasury/oclc/123498479), [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0064440028)) -
  This is a classic book (1958). Personally I find it tiresome but I was forced to
  read it many times and I can't deny the fact of its appeal even if I don't
  relate. I suppose part of it is that, as a dinosaur enthusiast, I take exception to
  the dinosaur in the book being some generic "dinosaur" that doesn't really resemble
  any real-life dinosaur species.

## More detailed for kids

* Prehistoric World (Usborne) ([Worldcat/2000](https://www.worldcat.org/title/usborne-world-history-prehistoric-world/oclc/896783088), [Worldcat/2012](https://www.worldcat.org/title/prehistoric-world/oclc/751835291), [Amazon/2000](https://smile.amazon.com/Prehistoric-World-History-Usborne/dp/0746027583), [Amazon/2012](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/140953426X))

  I loved the pictures in this book and it got read a lot. It goes from the dawn of life through early humans, with plenty of dinosaurs. The 2012 edition appears to be basically a reprint of the 2000 edition with a new cover.

* Modern Publishing (Rupert Oliver; Ron Wilson; Angela Royston; etc.)

  Omnibus editions of all Modern Publishing books. They are out-of-date (1980s) and the illustrations are sometimes goofy but my kid loves them and he really appreciates the large selection of animals that they cover. A few of the stories are truly memorable, including one (Allosaurus) that is the only children's story book I can think of that features the protagonist being killed and devoured in the final pages. There's a pretty large number of books in the series but I think all of them are collected in the four omnibus volumes that I list here.

  * Dinosaurs and Prehistoric Creatures (ISBN 1561447730, [Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/dinosaurs-and-prehistoric-creatures/oclc/18044792), [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/1561447730))
  * Colossal Book of Dinosaurs (ISBN 1561447757, [Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/colossal-book-of-dinosaurs-featuring-the-dinosaur-dictionary/oclc/38498607), [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/1561447757))
  * Mammoth Book of Dinosaurs (ISBN 1561447765, [WC](https://www.worldcat.org/title/mammoth-book-of-dinosaurs/oclc/868182676), [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/1561447765)
  * Dinosaurs Of The Land, Sea And Air (ISBN 1561447749, [WC](https://www.worldcat.org/title/dinosaurs-of-the-land-sea-and-air/oclc/609080515), [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/1561447749))

* Don Lessem
    * The Ultimate Dinopedia / Lessem and Tampesta
        (1e/2010 ISBN 1426301642,
        [Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/ultimate-dinopedia-the-most-complete-dinosaur-reference-ever/oclc/769762610),

        [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/1426329059)) -
      Full-page artwork of each dinosaur in action, along with pronunciation
      guides and entertaining text, make this a pretty ideal first "encyclopedia"
      type dinosaur book for both parent and child. I notice that there's a new
      edition (2nd, 2017) but I haven't seen it yet. I've noticed that the Franco
      Tempesta illustrations in this book show up in some National Geographic Kids
      books. (Reusing dinosaur illustrations happens a lot, read enough of these
      books and you'll start to see it all over the
      place!)
  * Meet the Dinosaurs series - Good books that list and discuss dinosaurs (and non-dinosaurs) of particular classifications.
    * Sea Giants of Dinosaur Time (ISBN 9780822514251,
        [Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/sea-giants-of-dinosaur-time/oclc/56095792),

  * Dinosaurs to Dodos: An Encyclopedia of Extinct Animals / Lessem and Sovak (ISBN 9780590316842 HC / 9780590316859 PB, [Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/dinosaurs-to-dodos-an-encyclopedia-of-extinct-animals/oclc/39281870), [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0590316842)) - A pretty good book with nice pictures, but The Ultimate Dinopedia is newer and has bigger pictures.

* National Geographic Dinosaurs / Paul Barrett (Au), Raul Martin (Ill), Kevin Padian (Ill)
    (2001, ISBN 978-0792282242, [Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/national-geographic-dinosaurs/oclc/818882284),
    [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/National-Geographic-Dinosaurs-Paul-Barrett/dp/0792282248))

  This is an excellent informational book that has continued to teach us new
  things even though we're already pretty far into reading about dinosaurs.
  The author has also written a good academic textbook about dinosaurs (listed
  below). Like a lot of books, it's a mix of thematic information and a
  dinosaur-by-dinosaur guide. Its guide portion has pretty good pictures,
  including a scale representation of each dinosaur next to a human (I've
  struggled so much to explain scale so this is really important for a little
  kid). It also contains lots of two-page spreads of nice dinosaur artwork.
  The text is brief and interesting enough that I can often read all or at
  least most of a page before the 3-year-old audience loses interest.

* Dougal Dixon

  Dougal Dixon is a very prolific author of dinosaur books. His books are
  generally pretty good in content but he sometimes makes errors and some
  volumes feature lousy digital art.

  * Reptiles rule: Triassic life; etc. (Awesome Ancient Animals)
  * Stegosaurus : and other plains dinosaurs; etc. (Dinosaur Find) - These books are basically collections of detailed scenes full of lots of dinosaurs, without much text. They are pretty good for a kid who just wants to look at the pictures and talk about what's in them.
  * Complete Illustrated Encyclopedia ([Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/complete-illustrated-encyclopedia-of-dinosaurs-prehistoric-creatures-the-ultimate-illustrated-reference-guide-to-1000-dinosaurs-and-prehistoric-creatures-with-2000-specially-commissioned-artworks-maps-and-photographs/oclc/944351418), [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/1846812097)) - The format of the new (2014) paperback edition of this one is really too small for what it is (6.8 x 8.5 inches), but it is cheap. It covers a very large number of dinosaur species, which makes it a wide-ranging reference, but it's not the most attractive for children and it doesn't have a lot to say about each species.

* Dinosaurs Through Time / Rupert Matthews, McRae Books
    (ISBN 8860980429, [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/8860980429))

  General overview of Mesozoic animal life, organized chronologically. It
  coverage doesn't really stand out, but nice full-page artwork makes it
  worthwhile (note that this is an oversize book so those full pages are big).
  It actually begins with the Permian, before dinosaurs first appeared.
  One criticism I have is that some of the images are clearly old and
  out-of-date even though this is a recent book (for example the Spinosaurus).

* Dinosaurs Through Time / Harris, Nicholas ; Scott, Peter David ; Dennis, Peter ([A](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/143582802X))

  Story of the life of a Mamenchisaurus from birth to death to fossilization.
  This book is fairly brief, and each two-page spread shows a scene in the
  dinosaur's life. It is nicely illustrated and thought-provoking.

* Zoehfeld and Washburn (Let's Read and Find Out Science) - Excellent book that each focus on a fairly narrow topic.
  * Where did dinosaurs come from? ([w](https://www.worldcat.org/title/where-did-dinosaurs-come-from/oclc/813919873), [a](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0064452166)) - History of evolution up until the dinosaurs.

* Life-size dinosaurs / Bergen, David ([w](https://www.worldcat.org/title/life-size-dinosaurs/oclc/56389198), [a](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/140271775X))

* Hannah Bonner
  * A Cartoon Prehistory of Life - I appreciated this series a lot because it emphasizes the major periods of evolution rather than individual species. It's a really fresh presentation that I would've liked to spend more time with. However, I found it difficult to explain to my son because it has many humorous cartoons. Jokes are always difficult to explain because it's hard to convey what should and shouldn't be taken literally; because of this, I feel like this is better suited to somewhat older children. Still worth a look for the little ones, but don't expect them to fully appreciate it.
    * 2012 omnibus: *When Fish Got Feet, When Bugs Were Big, and When Dinos Dawned* (ISBN 1426321058, [Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/when-fish-got-feet-when-bugs-were-big-when-dinos-dawned-a-cartoon-prehistory-of-life-on-earth/oclc/973542194), [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/When-Fish-Feet-Dinos-Dawned/dp/1426321058))

  * *Dining With Dinosaurs: A Tasty Guide to Mesozoic Munching* (ISBN 1426323395, [Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/dining-with-dinosaurs-a-tasty-guide-to-mesozoic-munching/oclc/959966623), [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/1426323395)) - I haven't seen this new book yet but it looks similar to her others.
  
* Can you tell a Brachiosaurus from an Apatosaurus? / Silverman, Buffy ([Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/can-you-tell-brachiosaurus-from-a-apatosaurus/oclc/988929776)) - A question that I asked a lot when we first started reading dinosaur books.
* Dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures / Bergin, Mark -- Easy-to-follow dinosaur drawing book. (ISBN  9781435826465, [Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/dinosaurs-and-other-prehistoric-creatures/oclc/212893645))

* I Am a Tyrannosaurus / Wallace, Karen ; Bostock, Mike ([Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/i-am-a-tyrannosaurus/oclc/61439566))

  A gripping first-person account of the life and times of a tyrannosaurus. Don't read it if you don't want to see a tyrannosaurs devouring a baby triceratops. (But you probaby do want to see that.)

* Imagine you are a crocodile / Wallace, Karen ; Bostock, Mike <https://www.worldcat.org/title/imagine-you-are-a-crocodile/oclc/51527511>

* I am an ankylosaurus / Wallace, Karen ; Bostock, Mike <https://www.worldcat.org/title/i-am-an-ankylosaurus/oclc/52782911>

* Dinosaurs / Long, John (ISBN 9781416938576, [Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/dinosaurs/oclc/122715493))

  An average dinosaur book that we got some entertainment from.

* Monster fliers: from the time of the dinosaurs / MacLeod, Elizabeth ; Bindon, John <https://www.worldcat.org/title/monster-fliers-from-the-time-of-the-dinosaurs/oclc/394994459> - Nice illustrations of pterosaurs.

## Adult books with enough pictures to be of some interest to kids

* Dinosaurs : the most complete, up-to-date encyclopedia for dinosaur lovers of all ages / Holtz, Thomas R ; Rey, Luis V

  A bit of false adversiting here: this is not really great for all ages, as
  the format is not very kid-friendly. Most of the above books have a layout
  that presents information a page or two at a time, but this one is organized
  in chapters with text flowing around inset images, like a typical adult book.
  This means you won't actually be reading the text to a young child. However,
  it still has enough pictures that you can have fun paging through it, talking
  about the pictures and reading the captions. Each chapter has a picture of
  several related dinosaurs side-by-side, those are fun to look at.

* Dinosaurs: 

## Beyond kids

## Textbooks

My son asks so many questions about dinosaurs that I decided I had to get out
ahead of him by reading some serious books about dinosaurs and other animals.
Here's what I found along those lines.

I don't have much background in anatomy, and these contain lots of terminology
that I'm not familiar with. If you're in the same boat, then Kardong's
vertebrate anatomy book (ISBN 9780073040585,
[Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/vertebrates-comparative-anatomy-function-evolution/oclc/901203971),
[Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0073040584))
should be helpful. (It's an excellent book in any case.)

* Fastovsky, Weishampel, Sibbick (illustrator). *Dinosaurs: a concise natural history*

  Excellent and entertaining overview of dinosaurs. Begins with an good
  overview of the different classifications of dinosaurs, discussing their
  features and cladograms, with a particular emphasis on what they ate. Has
  comparative illustrations of the skulls of many species.

* Naish, Barrett. *Dinosaurs: How They Lived and Evolved* (2016, ISBN 9781588345820, [Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/dinosaurs-how-they-lived-and-evolved/oclc/961155529), [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/1588345823)) - Lacks information about particular dinosaurs, it's more of a thematic overview. I liked the chapter on the K-Tr extinction.

  [Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/vertebrate-paleontology/oclc/41942716),
  [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0226724883)) - My impression from reading
  about this book is that, while it's outdated, it's still considered great and
  it's the book that a generation of paleontologists learned from.
* Carroll. *Vertebrate Paleontology and Evolution* (1990, ISBN 978-0716718222,
  [Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/vertebrate-paleontology-and-evolution/oclc/922750908),
  [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0716718227)) - A more recent classic
  paleontology book, though also outdated.
* Benton. *Vertebrate Paleontology* (3e/2014: ISBN 9781118406847,
  [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/1118406842)) - Seems the be the standard
  textbook for the field currently.
