Baby books, dinosaur-themed stories

* Stomp, Dinosaur, Stomp / Margaret Mayo ([Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/stomp-dinosaur-stomp/oclc/988922247&referer=brief_results), [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/140830385X))
* Dinosaur Days / Joyce Milton (1985 edition: [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00430CY9I), [Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/dinosaurs/oclc/758978206); 2014 edition: [Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/dinosaur-days/oclc/890680143), [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0385379234)) - The 1985 edition of this book had a lot of staying power early on in our dinosaur phase, and we read it so much that my son had it mostly memorized. Although it's not poetry, the simple words have a nice cadence. The 1985 edition is somewhat outdated, but not painfully so, and I prefer its art style to the newer one.
* Dinosaurs: 4 favorite stories (Scholaster Reader Collection) ([Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/dinosaurs/oclc/954612918&referer=brief_results), [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/Dinosaurs-Grace-Maccarone/dp/0439932513))

  * How Do Dinosaurs Say Goodnight? ([Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/how-do-dinosaurs-say-good-night/oclc/712597120&referer=brief_results), [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0590316818))
  * How Do Dinosaurs Go To School? ([Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/How-Do-Dinosaurs-Go-School/dp/0439020816))
  * etc.

* Danny and the Dinosaur / Hoff ([Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/danny-and-the-dinosaur/oclc/965731837&referer=brief_results), [Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/danny-and-the-dinosaur-treasury/oclc/123498479&referer=brief_results), [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0064440028))

More detailed for kids

* Prehistoric World (Usborne) ([Worldcat/2000](https://www.worldcat.org/title/usborne-world-history-prehistoric-world/oclc/896783088&referer=brief_results), [Worldcat/2012](https://www.worldcat.org/title/prehistoric-world/oclc/751835291&referer=brief_results), [Amazon/2000](https://smile.amazon.com/Prehistoric-World-History-Usborne/dp/0746027583), [Amazon/2012](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/140953426X))

  I loved the pictures in this book and it got read a lot. It goes from the dawn of life through early humans, with plenty of dinosaurs. The 2012 edition appears to be basically a reprint of the 2000 edition with a new cover.

* Modern Publishing (Rupert Oliver, etc.)

  Omnibus editions of all Modern Publishing books. They are out-of-date (1980s) and the illustrations are sometimes goofy but my kid loves them and he really appreciates the large selection of animals that they cover. A few of the stories are truly memorable, including one (Allosaurus) that is the only children's story book I can think of that features the protagonist being killed and devoured in the final pages.

  * Dinosaurs and Prehistoric Creatures ([Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/dinosaurs-and-prehistoric-creatures/oclc/18044792), [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/1561447730))
  * Colossal Book of Dinosaurs ([Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/colossal-book-of-dinosaurs-featuring-the-dinosaur-dictionary/oclc/56719686)?, [Worldcat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/colossal-book-of-dinosaurs/oclc/732707576)?, [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/1561447757))
  * Mammoth Book of Dinosaurs([WC](https://www.worldcat.org/title/mammoth-book-of-dinosaurs/oclc/868182676), [WC](https://www.worldcat.org/title/mammoth-book-of-dinosaurs/oclc/767737927), [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/1561447765)

It covers a very large number of dinosaur species, which makes it a wide-ranging reference, but it's not the most attractive for children and it doesn't have a lot to say about each species.
