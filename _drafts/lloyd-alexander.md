# Author Spotlight: Lloyd Alexander

Lloyd Alexander was a pretty well-known author of children's fantasy novels in the 1960's and 1970's.
Probably the pinnacle of his fame was in 1985 when Disney
made an animated adapation of his book *The Black Cauldron*.

What I didn't realize until recently was that he also wrote several picture books, and they are beautifully illustrated.

## Picture Books

### The King's Fountain, illustrated by Ezra Jack Keats, 1971

Ezra Jack Keats is a well-known author in his own right, mostly famous for writing
[The Snowy Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Snowy_Day) (which won the Caldecott Medal).
I've never seen another book by Keats besides *The Snowy Day*, which I regard as mediocre visually speaking.
This book, though, is brilliantly illustrated and makes me want to hunt down more of Keats's illustration work.

### How the Cat Swallowed Thunder, illustrated by Judith Byron Schachner

The illustrations in this one are not as impressive as the others, but they have character, and the story is good.
This is a sort of [just-so story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_So_Stories) that explains how the cat got its purr.
It is on another of Alexander's favorite themes, cats.
