## Author Spotlight: Lloyd Alexander

Lloyd Alexander was a pretty well-known author of children's fantasy novels in the 1960's and 1970's.
Probably the pinnacle of his fame was in 1985 when Disney
made an animated adapation of his book *The Last Cauldron*.

What I didn't realize until recently was that he also wrote several picture books, and they are beautifully illustrated.

### The King's Fountain, illustrated by Ezra Jack Keats, 1971

Ezra Jack Keats is a well-known author in his own right, mostly famous for writing
[The Snowy Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Snowy_Day), which won the Caldecott Medal.
I've never seen another book by Keats besides *The Snowy Day*, which I regard as mediocre visually speaking.
This book, though, is brilliantly illustrated and makes me want to hunt down more of Keats's work.
